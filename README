The code files "code_Fig3.ode" and "code_Fig4.ode" were used for the
respective simulations of Fig. 3 and 7 in

HÃ¼bel, N. and Ullah, G., "Anions Govern Cell Volume: a Case Study of 
Relative Astrocytic and Neuronal Swelling in Spreading Depolarization",

The code is written for XPP/XPPAUT.


Running "code_Fig3.ode" yields the time series shown in the main parts
of Fig. 3. Changing "par s=0" to "par s=1" in line 45 (or equivalently
changing "s=0" to "s=1" in the parameter settings of the XPP/XPPAUT
graphical interface) changes the volume model from "derived" to
"exponential" (see manuscript) and yields the time series shown in the
insets of Fig. 3. The default plot setting in line 198 shows the
potentials. Uncommenting line 199 or 200 will show volumes and ion
concentrations, respectively.
In addition, by changing "par gcl_l=0.05" to "par gcl_l=0" in line 135
(or setting the parameter "gcl_l" to zero in the parameter interface
after opening the file with XPP/XPPAUT) will produce Fig. 4 of the
paper.

Running "code_Fig7.ode" yields the time series shown in Fig 7. The
plot setting in lines 239 (default), 240 and 241 show the potentials
volumes and relative volume changes. Note that the volume plot shows
absolute volumes as the differences between the "vli_line", the
"vle_line" and the "vlg_line".
